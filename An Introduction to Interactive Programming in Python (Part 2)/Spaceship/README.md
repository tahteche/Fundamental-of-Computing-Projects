# Spaceship (Asteroids Clone)

Clone of the Atari classic game, Asteroids. Learn more about the [original game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)).

The original one was released in 1979 so it no wonder my clone released in 2018 is better :-)

## Running the code.

The code is Python 2.7 written to run using the [CodeSkulptor environtment](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) (Python in your browser). It uses some libraries unique to the environment so it can't be used in the standard Python environment yet.

To run the code:

1. Follow this link to open the code in your browser: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user44_75zHJbzLJs_15.py
2. Click the 'play' button on the top left of the IDE to run the project
