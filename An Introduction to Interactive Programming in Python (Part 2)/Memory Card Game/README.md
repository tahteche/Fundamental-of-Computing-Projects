Cards are placed facing down. Turn any two cards up and if the match you get a point. If not you turn them back and try again till you match all cards. Learn more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)

## Running the code.

The code is Python 2.7 written to run using the [CodeSkulptor environtment](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) (Python in your browser). It uses some libraries unique to the environment so it can't be used in the standard Python environment yet.

To run the code:

1. Follow this link to open the code in your browser: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user44_3G72L8Tky5_2.py
2. Click the 'play' button on the top left of the IDE to run the project
