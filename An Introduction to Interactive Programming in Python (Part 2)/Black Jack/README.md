# Blackjack

Blackjack game I built with Python. Google "Blackjack" to know what it is 
;-)

## Running the code.

The code is Python 2.7 written to run using the [CodeSkulptor environtment](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) (Python in your browser). It uses some libraries unique to the environment so it can't be used in the standard Python environment yet.

To run the code:

1. Follow this link to open the code in your browser: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user44_IzwZ2X6wXD_6.py
2. Click the 'play' button on the top left of the IDE to run the project
