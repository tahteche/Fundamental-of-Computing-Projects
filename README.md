# Coursera's [Fundamentals of Computing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals) (created by Rice University)
## Course Creators: Luay Nakhleh, Joe Warren, John Greiner, Scott Rixner, Stephen Wong

Currently taking the "Fundamentals of Computing" specialisation by Cousera which comprises the following 6 courses and a capstone exam:

1. [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)
2. [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2)
3. [Principles of Computing (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-1)
4. [Principles of Computing (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-2)
5. [Algorithmic Thinking (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-thinking-1)
6. [Algorithmic Thinking (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-thinking-2)
7. [The Fundamentals of Computing Capstone Exam](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-computing-capstone)

Each course has its own folder. Just the code I wrote which I think I may need to look at later is in this repo.

## Running the code.

The code is Python 2.7 written to run using the [CodeSkulptor environtment](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) (Python in your browser). It uses some libraries unique to the environment so it can't be used in the standard Python environment.

To run the code:

1. Copy it from the file.
2. Paste in the [CodeSkulptor IDE](http://www.codeskulptor.org/)
3. Click the Run/Play button at the top left of the IDE to Run it!
