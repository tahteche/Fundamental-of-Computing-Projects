# My Projects for Rice University's [Fundamentals of Computing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals) (on Coursera)
## Course Creators: Luay Nakhleh, Joe Warren, John Greiner, Scott Rixner, Stephen Wong

Took the "Fundamentals of Computing" specialisation by Rice University on Coursera which comprises the following 6 courses and a capstone exam:

1. [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)
2. [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2)
3. [Principles of Computing (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-1)
4. [Principles of Computing (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-2)
5. [Algorithmic Thinking (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-thinking-1)
6. [Algorithmic Thinking (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-thinking-2)
7. [The Fundamentals of Computing Capstone Exam](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-computing-capstone)

Each course has its own folder. Just the code I wrote which I think I may need to look at later is in this repo.

## Running the code.

The code is Python 2.7 written to run using the [CodeSkulptor environtment](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) (Python in your browser). It uses some libraries unique to the environment so it can't be used in the standard Python environment yet.

To run the code:

Each projects's folder has a README file. In the README file there is a link to run the project.

1. Follow the link to open the the project in the CodeSkulptor Python web IDE.
2. Click the 'play' button on the top left of the IDE to run the project
