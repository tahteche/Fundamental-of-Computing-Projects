# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Why play Rock Paper Scissors when you can play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock?

More to that you don't even have to play because the code will play for you :-)

Just run the code as instructed below. 

## Running the code.

The code is Python 2.7 written to run using the [CodeSkulptor environtment](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) (Python in your browser). It uses some libraries unique to the environment so it can't be used in the standard Python environment yet.

To run the code:

1. Follow this link to open the code in your browser: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_H7ZPRqKOgQ_4.py
2. Click the 'play' button on the top left of the IDE to run the project
