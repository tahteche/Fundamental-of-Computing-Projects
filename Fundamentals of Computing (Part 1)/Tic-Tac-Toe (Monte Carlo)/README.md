# Tic-Tac-Toe

You already know Tic-Tac-Toe but I bet you never knew I had a machine Tic-Tac-Toe player you will never ever beat :-). Implemented using Monte Carlo simulation.

## Running the code.

The code is Python 2.7 written to run using the [CodeSkulptor environtment](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) (Python in your browser). It uses some libraries unique to the environment so it can't be used in the standard Python environment yet.

To run the code:

1. Follow this link to open the code in your browser: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user44_EcLo0NB0sh_4.py
2. Click the 'play' button on the top left of the IDE to run the project
